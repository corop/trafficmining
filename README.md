# TrafficMining  #
TrafficMining is an academic framework for testing and evaluating routing algorithms based on [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org) data. Actually this framework is not intended to replace current routing applications. The intention is to provide an easy to use framework for testing and developing new routing algorithms on real OpenStreetMap data without the need to deal with GUI code.

## News ##
  * GUI refactoring in progress (there's still quite some way to go :-/)
  * v2.1.1 Bugfix Release
  * v2.1.0 including A-Star search
  * Mai 2012: new Release v2.0.1 including several bugfixes
  * April 2012: OpenCycleMap integrated as mapProvider + some refactorings
  * January 2012: We're refactoring and cleaning up
  * Created a [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/group/trafficmining) for discussions etc
  * November 2011: we moved the development to Google Code

## Why would you want to use this project ##
For you as a developer and researcher, the trafficmining project provides:

  * A pluggable architecture for developing your own route search algorithms
  * A GUI that visualizes your results without having to do some GUI coding!
  * Easy integration of Web Map Services if you wish to do so
  * Easy access to a huge repository of data worldwide by using OpenStreetMap data (ever got a reject because you used "unrealistic, artificial" or "too small" data sets?)
  * If you don't want/need a GUI (for example just verify research results), you do not NEED the GUI. You can integrate the code into your code base rather easy. All algorithms can be started from your code as well.
