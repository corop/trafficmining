Open ToDos/Ideas for Paros 2.x:
############
- Save Recently Used Graph-Path for load Graph Dialog
- Pluggable Postprocessing Algorithms
- Map extraction that gives a hint about the loaded map by displaying sample points 
- Measurements of Algorithm Thread 
  - Usertime/CPUTime using ThreadMXBean
  - Memory by constantly checking Runtime.totalMemory
- Possibility to print/display height-profile of a found path/way
- Statistics with nicer String representations
- Statistics: copy to Clipboard as CSV
- PathPainter should regard possible Links in Path segments
- Properties file: add blacklist of attributes that shouldn't be imported by the graph loader (like edited by)
  later on, this blacklist should be editable via GUI
- Waypoints: change order via drag & drop, del, popupmenu
- Paint-graphs to improve paint speed on large graphs
- Load Map data from XAPI directly from OpenStreetMap
- use CacheTileProvider
- evaluate change of map component to the one used in JOSM
- evaluate the need of spatial index structures
- persistence layer for nodes/links/intermediate nodes, attributes
